Deliver the best Linux distribution freely to anyone, anywhere,
spy-free, featuring the latest versions of Open Source Software,
on a daily basis, without forced or otherwise intrusive update process.</p><p>

AdaSTOR/OS is SlackwreLinux-current branch repackaged into several SquashFS
images and delivered to you the DevOps way via iPXE and IPFS (planned).
New releases are build automatically whenever Patrick releases new packages.
Packages are grouped into 'slices' &nbsp; SquashFS archives, mounted read-only
and stacked to provide consistent filesystem image; with writable layer
mounted on top of them.  That way more than 98% of filesystem data is mounted
read-only and served from compressed storage, which reduces I/O, which is
beneficial from both performance and security standpoint.  The 'slices' are 
ready to be used "as-is" just after being downloaded (no installation step
required); moreover each participant host may serve them to others via IPFS
(planned), thus reducing bandwith cost of distribution.

data-name="Slackware">is Slackware Linux</h1><div class="sit"><h2>Origins</h2>
Few years ago I compressed my entire Slackware system with SquashFS to save
some space - and was amazed to see how much the system gained in terms of
loading speed as well.  This process was manual, slow, unreliable, and 
required rebuilding the image each time new packages installed or upgraded.
So after several iterations I figured out how to break Slackware
installation in pieces to make updates easier - and today is the day it can 
be tested by anyone willing to see Slackware installed within seconds.

Note: the system installed that way is 100% Slackware compatible - you can 
use install/remove/upgrade-pkg as with traditionally installed Slackware -
it is just sub-optimal, since removed packages do not free space, and 
upgraded packages consume additional space and are not compressed.
